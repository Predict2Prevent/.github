# Study Aims
# 
# Aim 1. Develop a Bayesian multilevel spatiotemporal model to identify individual, interpersonal, community, and societal factors that contribute to opioid OD.
# 
# Aim 2. Develop an efficient Bayesian spatiotemporal model to identify time-space OD clusters, and extend the model to construct a dynamic predictive model.
#
# Aim 3. Evaluate and predict policy and intervention effects through model-based simulation studies to provide practical guidance and decision-making support to public health officials.
#
# Code Protocol
#
# Each script shall have the title of the study, date, primary code author with contact information, code contributors, and primary datasets employed (eg. PHD) listed in the heading. Code feature requests, comments, suggestions, and questions shall be directed to the primary code author. No data is to be stored on the Github. Any code kept in a private repository is not to be shared outside the P2P team without authorization by the MPIs. Any commits shall be annotated with a high-level description of the changes made to the code in the extended description. Commits should be made using an individual's institutional email address associated with the P2P study.
